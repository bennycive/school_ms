Here is a sample README.md template for your project based on what weâ€™ve discussed. You can adapt it to your specific project needs:
School Management System

This is a School Management System built with Django, using two separate databases for different apps:

    SQLite for storing student information.
    MySQL for storing subject information.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

    Project Name: school
        App 1: student (for managing student data, stored in SQLite)
        App 2: subject (for managing subject data, stored in MySQL)

Features

    Multiple Database Support: Uses SQLite for student-related data and MySQL for subject-related data.
    Student Enrollment System: Students can enroll in subjects, but they cannot register for the same subject multiple times.
    Django Admin Integration: Manage students and subjects via the Django admin interface.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.12+
    Django 5.0.6
    SQLite (default Django database for student data)
    MySQL/MariaDB (for subject data)

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-system.git
cd school-management-system

2. Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Databases
a. Configure SQLite (for Students)

Django will use SQLite by default. No additional setup is required for the student app.
b. Configure MySQL (for Subjects)

Ensure you have MySQL or MariaDB installed and create a database for the subjects.

Run the following command in MySQL to create the database:

sql

CREATE DATABASE subjects_db;

# Add your MySQL database credentials in the DATABASES setting in settings.py:

python

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    },
    'subjects_db': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'subjects_db',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'"
        }
    }
}

4. Apply Migrations

# Run migrations to create the necessary tables for both databases.

bash

python manage.py migrate

5. Create a Superuser

# Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface.

bash

python manage.py createsuperuser

6. Run the Server

Start the Django development server.

bash

python manage.py runserver

# Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
7. Access the Django Admin

Log in to the Django admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin using the superuser credentials.
Database Commands

You can run database-specific commands for each app using the --database flag:

bash

# python manage.py migrate --database=subjects_db
# python manage.py migrate --database=default  # For SQLite

Models
Student (SQLite)

    first_name
    last_name
    age

Subject (MySQL)

    name
    description

Enrollment

    student (ForeignKey)
    subject_id (stored manually as an integer)
